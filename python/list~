# This is how you make a list

names = ["daniel", "david", "demetrius"]

# This is how you index a list
#

# This is how you search a list for an index

# We can insert into a list which moves list items after it
#
names.insert(0, "mary")

# We can add to the end of the list
#
names.append("Maya")

# We can take a value from the end of a list and return that
# value
#

# We can sort list

# We can remove a value from list
#
name.remove("Jay")

# We can split a string into a list using a specified delimiter
#
strring = 'the cat is brown'
lisst = strring.split(' ') # split using space as delimiter
# We can specify the number of splits by adding a second argument

# Can join a list (or other sequence) into a string using join() method
#
s = ['d', 'a', 'n']
ss = '--'.join(s) # d--a--n

# We loop through a list with a for loop
# The variable after 'for' is the loop variable. It will
# be assigned to every value in the list.

# To slice a list, we specify [start:end:step]
#
lis = range(1,11)
even = lis[2:11:2]

# The default start is 0. default end is end of list
#
odd = lis[::2]

# To move from right to left, we use a negative step
#

# We can also slice a list by applying a filter
# The first argument to filter() is a function used to filter the list
#

# Lambda is the anonymous function operator
# lambda is used to quicky define a function or to 
# define a nameless function
